        <h1>Why I chose these websites</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Motivational Quotes</h2>
        <p>This was my first idea becuase I love motivational quotes from books. However, in today society only a few handful will actually read a book.</p>
        <h2>Folklore</h2>
        <p> I feel native folklore is highly heard of and sometimes misunderstood. We are raised on stories not only for them to keep going, but as warning and lessons. Our spiritaul connection is a important role in our culture along with the folklore that are carried on from old.</p>
        <h2>Natiive Powwows</h2>
        <p>Native dance is not greatly known and powwow seemed to only be attended by natives. I feel other races feel they aren't invited, but most natives love it when others expose themselve to our culture. It means they are trying to understand us.
        This is why i figured why not make a website about different form of dances used at powwows and round dance, explaining the differences.
