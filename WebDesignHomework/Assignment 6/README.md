### MY Website design 

I've chosen the third option, Native American dance, on my idea list from week 5. I chose this as my design because I thought it would be more entertaining for my audience. We have several mini powwow and round dance coming up. Lastly, is mostly for myslef, I just want to listen to native music and share it. 

I will go for a more modern and elegant design for my website with Times new roman font, simple white and perhaps turquoise border for image or videos. 

## My input

Adjust the background was definitley a struggle because I played with several colors, but didn't enjoy how it felt on my eye. I stuck with white and changing the color of my font. The webpage turned out as I envisioned for a beginner web desginer and would love to continue improving on it. I experimentd on float with my images, that was a struggle and decided to take the image out. i'll add them back once I figure out how I want it.
