# **Week 3 Assignment**

###### This week materials were really interesting. I never really thought the Internet as being anything materialistic, but as super complex codes floating around through radio transmit or in wires. The lessons and videos were very informative of different perspectives of what is the Internet. 

Additionally, I got more information about terms used for the Web and Internet. Such as:

-A _Uniform Resource Locator_ (URLP is used in every website that allows users and servers to find a site quickly and easily.
-There are two URL; Absolute contains all of the protocols and information for the files location. Second relative contains no protocols or domain information.
-Protocol shows how the web browser will communicate with a web server, common is _Hypertext Transfer Protocol_.
-Domain is the main direction to your website and its content. 
-Paths uses instruction on how to navigate directories.
-Links connect one source of information to others of varying degree of relation.
